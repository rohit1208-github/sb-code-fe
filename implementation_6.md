   - Implement API client with axios
   - Create type definitions
   - Add error handling
   - Implement authentication
   ```

### Implementation Order

### Next Immediate Tasks

1. Create the staff management page with:

   - Staff listing component
   - Create/Edit forms
   - Role management integration

2. Implement the base template configuration:

   - Template editor
   - Preview functionality
   - Save/publish workflow

3. Set up the microsites configuration:
