## Overview

The project is a multi-branch restaurant admin console (and eventually full dynamic microsites) as outlined in the **project-description.md**. We plan to manage CRUD for branches, countries, staff roles, SEO configurations, microsites, and more. The chosen **tech stack** is **Next.js 13** with the App Router, **Tailwind CSS**, and **shadcn** for UI components.

### Key Objectives

1. Provide a **centralized admin console** (role-based) to handle:
   - Countries, branches, staff
   - Microsites with different menus, testimonials, location details
   - SEO and optimization features (WhatsApp links, base SEO settings)
2. Eventually build out the **front-facing** microsites for each branch using the same Next.js framework, integrating dynamic content as managed by the admin.

## Project Phases (Recap from the Description)

1. **Phase 1**: Initial Project Setup  
2. **Phase 2**: Core Admin Dashboard & Layout  
3. **Phase 3**: SB Management CRUD (Countries, Branches, Roles, Staff)  
4. **Phase 4**: Websites & Microsites Config  
5. **Phase 5**: Optimization & SEO  
6. **Phase 6**: Testing, Performance & Deployment

## Work Completed So Far

### 1. Folder Structure Creation

- **Objective**: Create a Next.js-friendly folder structure matching the high-level architecture in the project description.  
- **Action**: We generated directories for `(admin)`, `sb-management`, `websites`, `manage-components`, `optimization`, and supporting folders (`components`, `lib`, `hooks`, `services`, `styles`, `public`).  
- **Outcome**: We have a skeleton ready for building out the admin console. Each folder will hold related pages (e.g., `/(admin)/sb-management/countries`, etc.).

### 2. Choosing & Initializing Next.js 13

- **Objective**: Align with the project’s need for dynamic, server-side rendering, and a future extension to microsites and SEO.  
- **Action**: We manually initialized a Next.js 13 (TypeScript) project **in place** by installing **next**, **react**, **react-dom**, and creating minimal config files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.js`).  
- **Outcome**: We now have a viable Next.js environment with the **App Router**, leveraging the `app/` directory structure.

### 3. Tailwind CSS & shadcn Integration

- **Objective**: Use Tailwind for rapid styling and **shadcn** for pre-built, consistent UI components.  
- **Action**:
  1. Installed **tailwindcss**, **postcss**, **autoprefixer**.  
  2. Created (or manually wrote) a `tailwind.config.js` with the relevant `content` paths (e.g., `app/**/*` and `components/**/*`).  
  3. Added Tailwind directives (`@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`) to our global CSS.  
  4. Installed/initialized **shadcn** for UI component scaffolding (e.g., Button, Card).  
- **Outcome**: Verified a working Tailwind + shadcn environment by creating a minimal `page.tsx` that rendered styled text and a button.

### 4. Testing the Setup (`page.tsx`)

- **Objective**: Confirm that Next.js routing works with the new setup.  
- **Action**: We added a minimal `app/page.tsx` containing a simple functional component.  
- **Outcome**: On running `npm run dev`, browsing to `localhost:3000` displayed our test message and styling, validating that everything is wired correctly.

## Current Status

- We have a fully **bootstrapped** Next.js 13 project with TypeScript, Tailwind, and shadcn.  
- Our folder structure matches the **admin console** requirements (including placeholders for countries, branches, roles, staff, etc.).  
- We’ve successfully tested a basic route (`app/page.tsx`) to ensure the dev environment is functional.

## Transition to the Next Phase

### Next Phase in the Project Description

The next immediate phase (often referred to as **Phase 2** in our plan) involves:

1. Building a **global layout** (`app/layout.tsx`) to handle site-wide structure (fonts, metadata, global styling).
2. Creating an **admin layout** (`app/(admin)/layout.tsx`) with navigation (sidebar, top bar) that wraps all admin pages.
3. Setting up a basic **Admin Dashboard** (`(admin)/dashboard/page.tsx`) to display placeholders for dynamic data (e.g., staff count, recent menu items).

### How We’ll Approach It

- **Global Layout**: Provide consistent `<html>` and `<body>` elements, global metadata (title, description), and import `globals.css`.  
- **Admin Layout**: Add a sidebar or top nav for the admin interface, wrapping each `(admin)` child page in a consistent UI frame.  
- **Dashboard**: Integrate shadcn card components or placeholders representing different key metrics (e.g., “Total Staff” or “Branch Count”). Initially, these will be static placeholders. Later, we can wire them to real endpoints.

By completing **Phase 2**, we’ll have a visible skeleton of the admin console. This sets the stage for **Phase 3** (SB Management CRUD), where we’ll start building out real data listing and editing features for countries, branches, staff, etc.

## Summary & Next Steps

**Summary**:  
- We established a robust Next.js 13 + TypeScript project, integrated Tailwind and shadcn, and verified it with a minimal test page.  
- Our folder structure aligns with the multi-branch restaurant admin console requirements, ensuring an organized approach to future expansions.

**Next Steps**:  
- Implement a global layout for basic site-wide styling and metadata.  
- Create the admin layout with navigation for `(admin)` pages.  
- Build a placeholder dashboard under `(admin)/dashboard` to serve as the console’s primary landing page.  
- Once the layouts and basic dashboard are complete, move on to **SB Management CRUD** for countries, branches, and roles in **Phase 3**.
